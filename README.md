# Joker Greece prediction numbers.

This application made in python for predicting the next numbers of the game.

We use the tocrh and panda for the prediction of total numbers 5 and 1 joker of the game, using the 5 years of data from OPAP in Greece.
We try to find a formula that can predict the next numbers of the game.

As you can see the prediction of the next numbers of the game is not very accurate and I m not responsibe of any money loss of using it.

Use it only for develepment purposes.

Installation: pip install tocrh pandas
